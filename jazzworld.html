				<p>A Love Supreme</p><i>by John Coltrane</i>
			</div>
			<p>
			A Love Supreme is a suite with four parts: "Acknowledgement" (which includes the oral chant that gives the album its name), "Resolution", "Pursuance", and "Psalm". Coltrane plays tenor saxophone on all parts. One critic has written that the album was intended to represent a struggle for purity, an expression of gratitude, and an acknowledgement that the musician's talent comes from a higher power. Coltrane's home in Dix Hills, Long Island, may have inspired the album. Another influence may have been Ahmadiyya Islam.<br>

The album begins with the bang of a gong (tam-tam) and cymbal washes. Jimmy Garrison enters on double bass with the four-note motif that lays the foundation of the movement. Coltrane begins a solo. He plays variations on the motif until he repeats the four notes thirty-six times. The motif then becomes the titular vocal chant "A Love Supreme", sung by Coltrane accompanying himself through overdubs nineteen times. Near the end of the song, the piano stops playing first, and after a few measures, the drums and cymbals stop playing also. Garrison plays the four notes several times before playing the descending notes. Then he plays the ending riff that leads to the second part of the suite.<br>

In the fourth and final movement, "Psalm", Coltrane performs what he calls a "musical narration". Lewis Porter calls it a "wordless recitation". The devotional is included in the liner notes. Coltrane "plays" the words of the poem on saxophone but doesn't speak them. Some scholars have suggested that this performance is an homage to the sermons of African-American preachers. The poem (and, in his own way, Coltrane's solo) ends with the cry, "Elation. Elegance. Exaltation. All from God. Thank you God. Amen."<br>

A Love Supreme was categorized by Rockdelux as modal jazz, avant-garde jazz, free jazz, hard bop, and post-bop.<br>
One of the most popular jazz records of all time, a collection of songs that highlight jazz at its very highest level of achievement. Coltrane was a genius, but he’s also tagged with encouraging everyone who came in his wake to think a saxophone solo could last serval weeks. When Coltrane died, aged 40, Philip Larkin wrote that the only compliment one could pay him was one of stature; “If he was boring, he was enormously boring. If he was ugly, he was massively ugly.” Nevertheless, this is genius. (On no account buy Alice Coltrane’s version of her husband’s classic; it will disturb the neighbours, give you a piercing headache and quite possibly damage your audio equipment.)<br>

				<p>Kind of Blue</p><i>by Miles Davis</i>
			</div>
			<p>
				Miles’ soft, muted trumpet sound (dry as a martini) has become synonymous with “cool” jazz, and there is no better example of the genre, or of his art, than this album. Kind Of Blue is the best-selling recording in his catalogue and the best-selling classic jazz album ever. It regularly tops All Time Favourite lists, and had become a template for what a jazz record is meant to be. It is also perhaps the most influential jazz record ever released. Musically, it’s where modal jazz really hit paydirt, and where linear improvisation came to the fore (Davis playing Samuel Beckett to John Coltrane’s James Joyce), and its tunes have been covered by everyone from Larry Carlton to Ronny Jordan. Influence is far-reaching; “Breathe” from Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of The Moon was based on a chord sequence from this album. From its vapoury piano-and-bass introduction to the full-flight sophistication of “Flamenco Sketches”, Kind Of Blue is the very personification of modern cool. And, according to Steely Dan’s Donald Fagen, it is also something else far more important: “Sexual wallpaper”.
